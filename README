#### Setup
All of the example projects and the bare bones project are set up with:
    - Bundler
    - Shotgun
    - Rack
    - Haml
    - Vlad the Deployer

To get up and running all that should be needed is to install the Ruby gem
Bundler if up don't already have it installed then run:
    - $ bundle install

  That should install everything that is need for the app to run. To start it
run:
    - $ shotgun

Update the config.ru file to change Shotgun settings. Likewise /config/deploy.rb for the Vlad settings and
Gemfile for your bundler install settings
